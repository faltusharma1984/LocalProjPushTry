 Analysis 

 Come up with Understanding Document for all these source system: 
                -Size of data.
                -Type of data we are going to receive -Snapshot/Delta.                
                -Data details for Source System as:
                                -Number of tables in each database.
                                -T/NT tables
                                -Number of files finally which would be used for reporting 
                                -if any other database referred internally by these source systems, User managed databases (if any).
                                -Database names and their owners.

                                                HLD,Detailed Design Doc, SIT Manual, Visio Diagrams, Unit Test Plan, CIT report & other supporting docs

 Dev database access (read/write) for all these source system - if not provided - Need to replicate all these databases                
                -script to replicate all the database/tables -

             Come up with D structure & creation of same in Development cluster

             Convert published files into required format & move to hdfs staging area  (Confirm with Abinitio/Informatica resource)

             Initial Load –E layer to Hadoop for Src System - Via Sqoop import 

             Daily transfer of delta/snapshot data from source system - (Confirm with Abinitio/Informatica resource)


             Hadoop Processing -SparseHistory/ CDC/Additional Processing – Src System
                - Delta Processing
                
                - Snapshot processing
                                                          
             Writing Unit test cases 

 Code Review 

             Creation of Hive tables/Impala Tables 
                

             CI onboard :  
-Creation of GIT repository  -done
– required branches 
- Jenkin Jobs(to be reused & tested)

             Data generation - Generate meaningful data 

             CIT - Testing end to end on PCB cluster with required wrapper Scritps- as per standard directory structure 

             Defect fixing
